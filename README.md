# Python-Data-mining

In this repository, there are 2 ipynb files. The first file shows codes used to merge raw data files, clean the data, and perform exploratory data anlysis to understand the data. The second file provides codes to run various types of analysis and modeling techniques including Linear and logistic regressions, linear mixed models, K-Nearest Neighbor used to predict lap times, race points, constructor points, etc. and factor analysis to identify any data redundancy and relationships between variables.
